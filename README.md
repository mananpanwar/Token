# Token Contract with Minting and Burning Functions

## Description
This project implements a basic Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity (which is a programming language used to create smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain) for a token named "Manan" with the abbreviation "Mn". The contract includes functionalities for minting and burning tokens. It maintains a public variable to store the total supply of tokens and uses a mapping to track token balances for each address. The mint function allows the creation of new tokens by increasing the total supply and adding tokens to a specified address. The burn function reduces the total supply and decreases the token balance of a specified address, ensuring the address has sufficient tokens to burn.
